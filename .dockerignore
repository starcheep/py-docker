# Items order in this file matters. Beware.
#
# How this file is structured is tightly coupled with:
# - how we structure our repositories
# - how our Dockerfile is made
# So again, beware.
#
# When modifying either this file or Dockerfile, always think that these two work together.

# Let's start.

# Even if no file matches 'gha-creds-*.json' inside this repository, do not delete this line.
# When running the CI workflow, credentials are generated by action google-github-actions/auth.
# These credentials shouldn't be leaked inside the docker image, so we exclude them.
# See https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#dirty-git-or-bundled-credentials
gha-creds-*.json

# Ignore everything by default.
# Yes, if we ignore everything now, ignoring gha-creds-*.json just above is kind of useless.
# But we prefer to be explicit, so that we don't forget about it.
*

# Allow only files and directories needed for the build.
